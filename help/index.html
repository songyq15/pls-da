    <h1>Hard and Soft Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analys (PLS-DA) Tool GUI help</h1>
<h2>
Introdiction
</h2>
The software implementation of hard and soft approaches to Partial Least Squares
Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> can be used for both multi-class and two-class
classification. <br/>The Soft PLS-DA is based on Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
applied to the super-score matrix T. It can simultaneously attribute a sample to several classes. It also
allows to detect samples, which are not members of any training classes, and, therefore, reduce a
number of false positives (e.g. in the presence of outliers). <br/>The Hard PLS-DA represents the
conventional PLS-DA classification. 
<br/><br/>
The toolbox provides instruments for data pre-processing as well as for interpretation and visualization of classification models. 
The main class, PLSDAModel, is responsible for the logic and contains implementation of both methods and auxiliary algorithms. 
The instance of this class has fields, which represent the actual model, and methods for data visualization and statistics.
The PLSDAGUI module provides graphical user interface, which allows user to create and manipulate
datasets, calibrate, test and explore models interactively. This class encapsulates all the
necessary data such as training or test sets and labels of the samples and variables. The PLS-DA Tool has its own
implementation of all necessary statistical functions and does not require the MATLAB Statistics
Toolbox.

<h2>PLSDAGUI</h2>
<p>The PLSDAGUI module provides the graphical user interface for classes DataSet and PLSDAModel. The <i>classes</i> subfolder contains auxiliary classes used by the GUI.</p>
<h3>Installation and first steps</h3>
To get the latest release plase use <a href="https://github.com/yzontov/pls-da/">GitHub sources</a>. 
One can clone the git repository or download the source as a zip-file and install it in your Matlab environment. 
<ul>
	<li>To use the Tool you should set the Matlab current directory to the folder, which contains the Tool's main classes ("PLSDAGUI.m", "PLSDAModel.m", "DataSet.m") as well as all auxiliary files, or add this folder to the Matlab Path.</li>
	<li>By default it is assumed that none of the built-in Matlab functions on the user's machine has been overloaded due to the use of a third-party toolbox.</li>
	<li>Before you start working with the GUI you should load the data for analysis into the MATLAB workspace.</li>
	<li>The data set and model objects can be saved from the GUI to the MATLAB workspace.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The GUI window is separated into 3 tabs: Data, Model and Prediction. Their asvailability depends on the user's actions.
</p>
