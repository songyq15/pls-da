<h1>
Introdiction
</h1>
We present a software implementation of hard and soft approaches to Partial Least Squares
Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) [1]. The Soft PLS-DA is based on Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
applied to the super-score matrix T. It can simultaneously attribute a sample to several classes. It also
allows to detect samples, which are not members of any training classes, and, therefore, reduce a
number of false positives e.g. in the presence of outliers. The Hard PLS-DA represents mostly the
conventional PLS-DA classification. Thus the software can be used for both multi-class as well as two-class
classification.
Both methods are implemented as MATLAB toolbox, PLS-DA Tool, using object oriented
programming. The toolbox provides instruments for data pre-processing as well as for interpretation,
validation and visualization of classification models. The main class, PLSDAModel, is responsible for
the logic and contains implementation of both methods and auxiliary algorithms. The instance of this
class has fields, which represent the actual model, and methods for data visualization and statistics.
The PLSDAGUI class provides graphical user interface, where a user can create and manipulate
datasets, calibrate, validate and explore models interactively. This class encapsulates all the
necessary data such as training or validation sets and labels of the samples and variables, and uses
these elements for the model development and validation. The PLS-DA Tool has its own
implementation of all necessary statistical functions and does not require the MATLAB Statistics
Toolbox.
