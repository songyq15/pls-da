<h2 id="intro">Introdiction</h2>
The software implementation of hard and soft approaches to Partial Least Squares
Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> can be used for both multi-class and two-class
classification. <br/>The Soft PLS-DA is based on Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
applied to the super-score matrix T. It can simultaneously attribute a sample to several classes. It also
allows to detect samples, which are not members of any training classes, and, therefore, reduce a
number of false positives (e.g. in the presence of outliers). <br/>The Hard PLS-DA represents the
conventional PLS-DA classification. 
<br/><br/>
The toolbox provides instruments for data pre-processing as well as for interpretation and visualization of classification models. 
The main class, PLSDAModel, is responsible for the logic and contains implementation of both methods and auxiliary algorithms. 
The instance of this class has fields, which represent the actual model, and methods for data visualization and statistics.
The PLSDAGUI module provides graphical user interface, which allows user to create and manipulate
datasets, calibrate, test and explore models interactively. This class encapsulates all the
necessary data such as training or test sets and labels of the samples and variables. The PLS-DA Tool has its own
implementation of all necessary statistical functions and does not require the MATLAB Statistics
Toolbox. The PLS-DA Tool relies on several external functions, as well as GUI Layout Toolbox, which are uncluded in the package (in the <i>utils</i> sub-folder).
