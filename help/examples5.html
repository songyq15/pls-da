<h4 id="ex_predict">Working with the Cross-Validation tab</h4>
<i>The Cross-Validation tab becomes available when the current model is calibrated (on the Model tab).</i>
<p>
To apply a PLS-DA model to the new data:
<br/>
<i>Here we assume that a model was previously loaded into the GUI or created on the Model tab.</i>
<ol>
    <li>On the <b>Prediction</b> tab select a test or new dataset from the <b>New or Test Data Set</b> drop-down list.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Predict</b> button.</li>
    <li>One can analyze the results visually on the <i>Graphical view</i> sub-tab.</li>
    <li>The Allocation matrix is available on the <i>Table view</i> sub-tab.</li>
    <li>In case of a Test dataset (when Classes are known) the Confusion matrix and Figures of merit are also available on the <i>Table view</i> sub-tab.</li>
    <li>One can use <b>Save image to file</b> and <b>Copy image to clipboard</b> to store the image in the <i>Graphical view</i> tab to disk or clipboard.</li>
    <li>One can use <b>Save tables to file</b> and <b>Copy tables to clipboard</b> buttons to store the Allocation matrix, Confusion matrix and Figures of merit to disk or clipboard.</li>
</ol>

The Cross-Validation tab contains the settings panel and the right panel two sub-tabs: Data and Results.

The settings panel contains the name of the dataset (same as the selected dataset on the Model tab), model parameters and cross-validation specific settings.
The dataset, type of the model and the minimum number of PLS components are being shown for your information.
The maximum number of PLS components as well as the Type I error can be adjusted on the Model settings panel.
The cross-validation is performed for numbers of PLS components from minimum to maximum with the step of one.
To perform cross-validation for a range of Type I error you can indicate different values and step on the Model settings panel.
You can use controls on the cross-validation settings panel to select the way of splitting the dataset into training and test sub-sets.
The following types are available: Leave-One-Out, K-fold, Holdout and Mont-Carlo. Additional input fields will appear when you select different split type.
If you click the Split button
